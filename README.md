# leetGPU

**leetGPU** is a repository for daily CUDA coding practice.

All problems are from [leetgpu.com](https://leetgpu.com/).

## **Structure**

- Each problem is saved as a .cu file, using lowercase with underscores (e.g., vector_addition.cu).
- Use gen_cu.sh to quickly generate a template file with the correct name format.

## **Usage**

```
./gen_cu.sh "Problem Name"
# Example: ./gen_cu.sh "Vector Addition"
# This will create vector_addition.cu
```
